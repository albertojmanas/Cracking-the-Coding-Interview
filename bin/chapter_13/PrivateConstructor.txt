Private Constructor: In terms of inheritance, what is the effect of keeping a constructor private?

Answer: Keeping the constructor private only allows access to the constructor through other private
methods. The use of the private constructor can only be access through a method or the child's
constructor given that within a child's constructor it calls the super classes constructor in order
to create and object with related variables. Such as a Student class extends Name. When calling 
the Student constructor you may be inputing data into name(firstName, lastName) that will get passed
to the Name constructor in the name class only accessed by the Student constructor through 
inheritance.
