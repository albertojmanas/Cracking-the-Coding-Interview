What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize?

Answer: final is attached to a static variable to indicate that the variable is a constant,
that cannot be changed. finally is the block of code that gets executed after and try-catch code block
to ensure that code gets executed regardless of exception caught and thrown within the catch.
finalize method is depreciated and is utilized to perform cleanups and disposed of unwanted system 
resources.
